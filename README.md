# RD-DGP: Regularized Diffusion-based Deep Generative Prior üöÄ

## Overview

RD-DGP is a Python framework designed for solving imaging inverse problems by leveraging the power of pre-trained diffusion models as priors. This project implements and allows experimentation with several cutting-edge algorithms, including:

* **Deep Generative Prior (DGP-style)**: Optimizing in the latent space of a diffusion model.
* **Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS)**: Iteratively sampling from an approximate posterior distribution.
* **DiffPIR (Diffusion Model for Plug-and-Play Image Restoration)**: An iterative method combining data consistency with diffusion model denoising.
* **Unconditional Sample Generation**: For generating samples directly from the diffusion model.

The framework emphasizes flexibility and ease of experimentation through a YAML-based configuration system, support for various models (local and Hugging Face Hub), and dynamic handling of RGB or grayscale images.


## ‚ú® Features

* **Multiple Inversion Algorithms**: Implements DGP, DPS, and DiffPIR.
* **Config-Driven**: Easily manage all experimental parameters via YAML files.
* **Flexible Model Loading**: Supports local model paths and direct loading from Hugging Face Hub (`UNet2DModel`).
* **Image Versatility**: Handles both RGB (3-channel) and grayscale (1-channel) images.
* **Modular Code**: Solver classes for each algorithm and shared utility functions for clean and maintainable code.
* **Comprehensive Logging**: Built-in logging to console and file for each experiment run.
* **Customizable Operators**: Integrates with the `IPPy` library for forward operators (e.g., Deblurring, CT).

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.8+
* PyTorch (e.g., 1.10+ or 2.x)
* `diffusers` and `transformers` libraries from Hugging Face
* Other common scientific Python packages (`numpy`, `matplotlib`, etc.)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/devangelista2/RD-DGP RD-DGP
    cd RD-DGP
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    Run:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    to install all the required dependencies.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

All experiments are controlled via a YAML configuration files (e.g., `configs/mayo_ct.yaml`). This file contains sections for general settings, model paths, image details, operator parameters, and specific parameters for each algorithm.

**Key Configuration Sections Example:**

```yaml

## üöÄ Usage

### Running Individual Experiments

Each algorithm can be run using its dedicated Python script. Ensure your configuration file (e.g., `configs/main_config.yaml`) is correctly set up for the desired experiment.

**Example for running DGP:**
```bash
python main.py --config configs/<config_file_name>.yaml --dgp
```

**Example for running DPS:**
```bash
python main.py --config configs/<config_file_name>.yaml --dps
```

**Example for running DiffPIR:**
```bash
python main.py --config configs/<config_file_name>.yaml --diffpir
```

**Example for running sample generation:**
```bash
python run_generation.py --config configs/<config_file_name>.yaml
```

## üß™ Implemented Algorithms

* **Deep Generative Prior (DGP-style)**: Optimizes a latent code `z` to minimize a data consistency loss, where the image is generated by `x = G(z)` using a diffusion model `G` as the generator.
* **Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS)**: An iterative method that combines the score of a diffusion model (prior) with the gradient of the likelihood (data consistency) to sample from an approximate posterior distribution.
* **DiffPIR (Diffusion Model for Plug-and-Play Image Restoration)**: A plug-and-play restoration method that alternates between a data-fidelity update step (e.g., gradient descent) and a denoising step using a pre-trained diffusion model.
* **Unconditional Generation**: Standard reverse diffusion process (e.g., DDIM sampling) to generate samples from random noise, using a pre-trained `UNet2DModel` and `DDIMScheduler`.
